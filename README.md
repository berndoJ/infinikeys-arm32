# InfiniKeys ARM32

InfiniKeys is an extensible and flexible ARM32 firmware for custom made keyboards.

The goal is to provide an open-source keyboard firmware that is fully customisable in terms of
keyboard layout and function. There will be a Windows application built, which enables config
of the keyboard over USB.

This firmware is designed to run on any 32-bit ARM microcontroller, enabling high flexibility
in terms of microcontroller choice. In the future there may be a port to AVR 8-bit systems, but
this decision is not final yet.

Currently this project is WIP - so not functional yet.
